// In C++, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be a base class for other classes. An abstract class typically includes at least one pure virtual function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of both concepts:

// Abstract Class
// An abstract class in C++ is a class that is meant to be inherited from and cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class is declared by including at least one pure virtual function.

// Pure Virtual Function
// A pure virtual function is a function that is declared in a base class but is meant to be overridden in derived classes. A pure virtual function has no implementation in the base class and is specified by assigning 0 to the function declaration.

// Abstract class aik aisi class jisy obj create krny k liye use nai kr skty it is designed that derived classes is created from it
